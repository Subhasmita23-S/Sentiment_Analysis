## Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using NLP
This project performs **sentiment analysis** on Twitter data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify tweets into **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative** sentiments based on their textual content. This analysis is useful for understanding public opinion, social trends, and customer feedback at scale.

## Summary
The explosion of social media platforms like Twitter has transformed the way people express their opinions, emotions, and thoughts in real time. Twitter, in particular, serves as a dynamic platform where users freely share their experiences about products, services, events, and public figures. This study aims to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data using several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MPL) classifiers.

## Tools & Libraries Used
### Data cleaning & NLP
- **reg** regular expressions for text cleaning
- **NLTK** tokenization, stop word removal, stemming
- **Scikit-learn** vectorization(TF-IDF, CountVectorizer), model building, evaluation
